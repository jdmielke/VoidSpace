Description
-----------

Your ship has been sucked into an area of space known as the void space. There is no escape so now you must upgrade your ship in order to survive the unknown expanse that you are now trapped in. Pirates along with a mysterious entity are also trapped in this void and will try to stop you.

VoidSpace is being created as a bullet hell space mmo. The Core idea behind the game is to upgrade your ship with equipment found out in space. This equipment will be found off of drops from mobs of increasing dificulty as you travel further out into the void space.
